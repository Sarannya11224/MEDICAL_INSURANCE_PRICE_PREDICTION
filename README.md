This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of the dataset "insurance.csv," which contains information related to various aspects of insurance policies. The dataset includes variables such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region, along with the insurance charges incurred. Our primary goal is to explore the relationships between these factors and their impact on insurance costs
